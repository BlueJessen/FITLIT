### Introduction
Have you ever had trouble keeping track of all your goals and info when trying to get healthy or stay fit? If so, **FITLIT** is here for you!

FITLIT is a webpage that allows you to keep track of fitness, sleep and even hydration information for you and all your friends. So fear not! from now on all your fitness info will be there when you need it with FITLIT.

### Reflections
- During this project we learned that javascript being dry and succinct makes it easier to implement the css and DOM manipulation, and in the future we want to make that consideration as we're building out a program.
- We decided to add features (such as local storage) to the webpage, even though these lessons were not formally taught. To give ourselves more experience with webpack and npm.
- Teamwork makes the dream work.

### Future Features
- Allow users to select which user in the data set to display.
- Add widgets with info on each of a user's friends.
- Redesign/condense display of info in the data card in the sidebar.
- Add Login Page for an Admin & Users.
